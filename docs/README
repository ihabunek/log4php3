This directory contains the documentation for Apache log4php.

The documentation is in reStructuredText (ReST) format [1] and can be viewed 
using any text editor. Conversion to other formats, such as html, epub and pdf
is achieved by using the Sphinx documentation system [2], and requires 
Python.

To render the documentation to HTML:
* install Sphinx (using ``sudo pip install Sphinx`` or some other method)
* while in the ``docs`` directory, run ``make html``

The documentation will be rendered to _build/html/.
