h1. Appenders

Logging requests can be sent to multiple destinations, such as files, databases, syslog and others. Such destinations are called appenders. Appenders are attached to "loggers":loggers.html and each logger can have multiple attached appenders.

h2. Appender reference

The following appender classes are available:

|_. Name |_. Destination |
| LoggerAppenderConsole | Console, directly to the stdout or stderr stream. |
| LoggerAppenderEcho | Console, using the PHP echo command. |
| LoggerAppenderFile | A file. |
| LoggerAppenderDailyFile | A file (new file each day). |
| LoggerAppenderRollingFile | A file (new file when a specified size has been reached). |
| LoggerAppenderMail | Sends the log via email. The entire log is sent in one email. |
| LoggerAppenderMailEvent | Sends the log via email. Each log entry is sent in individual emails. |
| LoggerAppenderMongoDB | MongoDB. |
| LoggerAppenderNull | Ignores all log events. |
| LoggerAppenderPDO | Database. |
| LoggerAppenderPhp | Creates a PHP user-level message using the PHP trigger_error() function. |
| LoggerAppenderSocket | A network socket. |
| LoggerAppenderSyslog | Syslog. |

h2. Configuring appenders


From the configuration you can see that an appender has the following properties:
* A *name* which uniquely identifies it, in this case _default_.
* A *class* which specifies which appender class will be used to handle the requests. Since we wish to log to a file, <code>LoggerAppenderFile</code> is used in this case.
* A *layout* which transforms the logging events to string which can be logged. A layout is required by most appenders, but some do not require it, such as the database appender. If a layout is not defined, the appenders will use a default layout.
* Zero or more *parameters* which configure the appender behaviour. In this example, the _file_ parameter governs the path to the file which will be used for logging, and _append_ defines that log messages should be appended to the file, instead of truncating it.

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
<configuration xmlns="http://logging.apache.org/log4php/">
    <appender name="default" class="LoggerAppenderFile">
        <layout class="LoggerLayoutSimple" />
        <param name="file" value="/var/log/my.log" />
        <param name="append" value="true" />
    </appender>
    <root>
        <appender_ref ref="default" />
    </root>
</configuration>
]]></pre>


h2. Linking appenders to loggers

A logger can be linked to one or more appenders. Also, multiple loggers can share the same appender.

Consider the following configuration:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
<log4php:configuration xmlns:log4php="http://logging.apache.org/log4php/">
    <appender name="primus" class="LoggerAppenderConsole" />
    <appender name="secundus" class="LoggerAppenderFile">
        <param name="file" value="/var/log/my.log" />
    </appender>
    <logger name="main">
        <appender_ref ref="primus" />
        <appender_ref ref="secundus" />
    </logger>
    <logger name="alternative">
        <appender_ref ref="primus" />
    </logger>
</log4php:configuration>
]]></pre>

This configures two appenders, called _primus_ and _secundus_, and two loggers named _main_ and _alternative_. The logger _main_ is linked to _primus_ and _secundus_ and will therefore forward logging events to both of them. In other words, it will log both to console and to a file. Logger _alternative_ is only linked to appender _primus_ and will therefore only log to the console.

h2. Appender threshold

An appender can be assigned a threshold level. All logging requests with level lower than this threshold will be ignored.

For example, if you set <code>WARN</code> as a threshold, then <code>INFO</code>, <code>DEBUG</code> and <code>TRACE</code> level events recieved by the appender will not be logged, but <code>WARN</code>, <code>ERROR</code> and <code>FATAL</code> will.

An example of setting an appender threshold:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><![CDATA[
<configuration xmlns="http://logging.apache.org/log4php/">
    <appender name="default" class="LoggerAppenderEcho" threshold="WARN" />
    <root>
        <appender_ref ref="default" />
    </root>
</configuration>
]]></pre>
